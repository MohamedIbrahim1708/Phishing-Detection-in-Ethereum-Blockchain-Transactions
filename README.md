Abstractâ€”Phishing attacks threaten blockchain security by deceiving miners into adding malicious blocks. Existing detection
techniques and consensus protocols fall short, especially when authorized miners inadvertently add these blocks. While zerotrust
policies could enhance detection, they are not widely implemented. Machine learning models offer a robust alternative
for identifying phishing attempts. This article examines various methods, recommending the Random Forest (RF) model for
effective phishing detection. With up to 99% accuracy, RF is the top choice for accurately and efficiently identifying phishing
threats, thereby strengthening blockchain security.
